## Project and contributors
This package was developped to test for a directional change in forest dynamics across ForestGEO sites. The main author is Ervan Rutishauser (er.rutishauser@gmail.com), former Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute Post-doc, with contribution from Helene Muller-Landau (current administrator; MullerH@si.edu) and Mauro Lepore.

## Main purpose of the package
This package has a main function **data_preparation()** that works either at stem (stem=T) or tree (stem=F) levels, and works in 2 steps:
 
### A. Complement the data
 
* compiles multiple censuses into a single file to,
* checks for consistency in stem/tree status (alive/dead) over time,
* (optional) fills gaps (i.e. missing DBHs or POM values) by simple linear interpolation (fill_missing=T),
* (optional) corrects POM changes through application of a taper correction (taper_correction=T),
* allocate wood density from CTFS wood density database and DRYAD
* estimates stem/tree above-ground dry biomass (AGB)
 
### B. Format the data
 
* merges information from stems to single tree for each census interval,
* codes if a tree is recruited, alive, dead or broken/resprouted
* computes annual **AGB productivity** (if alive), **ingrowth** (if recruited or resprouted) or **loss** (if dead) at tree-level
* flags obvious measurement errors (annual AGB growth > X % (X = maxrel) of mean annual AGB growth across all census intervals)
 The function returns a data.frame where each row correspond to the initial and final measurments (i.e. DBH, POM, status) per **tree** for a given census intervals. Variables related to the initial and final census are denoted with **1** and **2**, respectively. 

Variable are defined as follow:

| Variable | Definition
---------- | -------------
treeID     |  Unique tree ID
dbh1       |  Measured dbh at intial census
dbhc1      |  Corrected dbh at intial census
status1    |  Status (alive/dead) at intial census
code1      |  Original CTFS code at intial census
hom1       |  Original height of measurement at intial census 
sp         |  CTFS species name acronym
wsg        |  Wood-density allocated at lowest taxonomic level
agb1       |  Above-ground tree biomass estimate at initial census 
date1      |  Date of census
...        |
broken     |  Has the main stem DBH > 10cm broken (i.e. AGB reduction > 20%)? 
agbl       |  AGB loss due to main stem breakage
agb1.surv  |  AGB of surving stems (if any) after main stem breakage
interval   |  first, second, third... census interval
year       |  Calendar year of census
gx         |  X coordinate
gy         |  Y coordinate
quadrat    |  20x20m quadrat
name       |  Genus and species
ID         |  Concatenation of treeID and stem tag
int        |  Census interval length in days
code       |  Corrected tree status, can be: "A" = alive, "AC" = alive, with POM changed, "B" = broken, "Rsp" = resprouted, "R" = recruited or "D" = dead
dHOM       |  hom2-hom1
prod.g     |  annual AGB productivity for trees coded as "A" or "AC"
prod.r     |  annual AGB productivity for trees coded as "Rsp" or "R"
loss       |  annual AGB loss for trees coded as "B" or "D"
ficus      |  Is that tree a large (DBH > 50cm) strangler fig?
prod.rel   |  relative producitivity (prod.g/average-productivity-per-hectare)
error      |  Is prod.rel > maxrel (1), or prod.rel < -maxrel (-1)
error.loss |  Binary. Was that tree flagged as "error" prior to death?

Resulting data set can further be used to compute AGB fluxes at a site (as described below). 

## Installation
 You can install the released version of AGBfluxes from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:
 
``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("AGBfluxes")
```

	taper_correction=T,
	fill_missing=T,
	use_palm_allometry=T,
	flag_stranglers=T,
	dbh_stranglers=500,
	max_prod=.2,
